# Sport Center Manager - Group 17

## Scope of the Project
We are developing a website to facilitate the management of a sports center. The owner of the sports center will be able to create, schedule, modify and delete different classes (which can be categorised into various class types (cardio, stretching, strength). Each class has various sessions offerings occuring at different times. Instructors will be able to sign up to specific sessions they want to supervise and modify them as they wish. They can also create new classes which are subject to the owner's approval. The client will be able to create an account and sign up to sessions they want to attend.

These are just some of the features of our website, a more comprehensive overview can be found in the wiki.
